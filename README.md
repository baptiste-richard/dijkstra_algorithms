# dijkstra_algorithms

This folder contains two versions of the well known Dijkstra Algorithm:

- dijkstra.py features the algorithm in its most classic version

- dijkstra_cust.py offers additional functionality: user can choose an origin a wherever he wants in the graph and get shortest path to any other nodes. This version also allows to limit the number of steps k in the algorithm (complete iterations)

Two csv files offer the possibility to test the algorithm on a practical dataset.
